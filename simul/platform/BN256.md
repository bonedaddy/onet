# BN256 Pairing-Based Crypto

For using pairing based crypto directly with onet, the current state of the art
asks for the following code in any of the simulation go-files:

```go
var Suite = bn256.NewSuiteG2()

func init(){
  cothority.Suite = Suite
}
```

The .toml-file should have a line like:

```toml
Suite = "combined:bn256.g2"
TAGS = "vartime"
```

Then, while compiling, you need to give:

```bash
go build -tags vartime && ./simul simul.toml
```

# Better way

An even better way, but not supported yet, is to create your own keypair in the
service and then use that, leaving the `cothority.Suite` untouched. But for
this we will need to set up some PKI where the conode can sign a new keypair
to proof it comes from the conode itself.
